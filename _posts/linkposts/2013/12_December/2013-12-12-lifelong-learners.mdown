title:  "MOOCs and Lifelong Learners"
subtitle:  "Why should schools and investors be sinking millions into creating educational resources (i.e., MOOCs) that we all know just benefit older, educated, professional (and by implication well-off, middle-class) lifelong learners who already have so much, vs. using those same resources to advance the education of the neediest."
